The full-functional example that shows how to use MFML.

Uses TypeScript, Rollup, MFML and dynamic imports.

Use `npm ci && npm run watch` to start the example watcher.

**Note:** Rollup doesn't watch https://github.com/smikhalevski/mfml/blob/master/example/src/translations/en-US.json
and https://github.com/smikhalevski/mfml/blob/master/example/src/translations/en-US.json, so you would need to restart
the watcher to recompile translations with MFML.
